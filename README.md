This is a clone of the Google Search Results page.

In the previous Google Homepage clone project, I downloaded icons as images to my local machine and used them. For this project, I used Google Material Icons as the main source for all the icons to achieve better quality. The only exception is the Favicon and the image in the Related Searches section.

I leveraged Flexbox and CSS grid in the stylesheet. At first I used 'fr' as the measurement unit for the grid-template-column however I realized that the logo and the body part stay put when resizing browser. So I switched to a fixed width instead. 

Disclaimer: I didn't consult the source code and this is a total makeshift, hence the styling might be off. This is my attempt at creating a clone of Google Search results page without actually looking at the source code.
